1, First of all youll need to have easy-rsa
sudo apt install easy-rsa

2, Become root
sudo su

3, Go to the easy-rsa folder
cd /usr/share/easy-rsa

4, Copy example config file
cp vars.example vars

5, Open vars in your preffered text editor
vi vars

6, Uncomment these rows and fill in your values (CZ, Praha, Org. name...)
set_var EASYRSA_REQ_COUNTRY "CZ"
set_var EASYRSA_REQ_PROVINCE "Praha"
set_var EASYRSA_REQ_CITY "Praha"
set_var EASYRSA_REQ_ORG "Intel"
set_var EASYRSA_REQ_EMAIL "ca@localhost"
set_var EASYRSA_REQ_OU "Unit"

7, Generate cert
./easyrsa init-pki (type yes if required)
./easyrsa build-ca (type password 2times, then type your server name)

8, Copy cert to your home
cp /usr/share/easy-rsa/pki/ca.crt ~ubuntu20/ (NOTE that ubuntu20 is my home, your will be different)
sudo chmod +r ca.crt (run this command from user terminal (no root), it changes permissions from root to user.)

9, Next command run from "/usr/share/easy-rsa" path
!! IMPORTANT !! local.max.support is my server name, choose your own
./easyrsa build-server-full local.max.support(type new password (2times) and then password we typed before)

10, Redirect from port 3000 to 443 (HTTPS)
sudo iptables -t nat -I OUTPUT -p tcp -d 127.0.0.1 --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 3000

11, Check if we make it correctly
vi /etc/hosts

127.0.0.1 localhost local.max.support (if your see this (with your server name), its probably correct.)

Another test:
ping local.max.support (If its responding GOOD JOB!)

12, Import ca.crt from your home to the browser as a Authority
In chrome:
Settings -> privacy and security -> Security -> Manage certificates -> Authorities -> Import

13, Move cert and key to your project /config
cd /usr/share/easy-rsa/pki/certs_by_serial (here is your cert, rename it from "hash".pem to yourServerName.crt (In my case local.max.support.crt))

cp local.max.support.crt ~ubuntu20/Desktop/centraldb-portal/config (COPY that file to your project /config)
cd /usr/share/easy-rsa/pki/private (here is your key)
cp local.max.support.key ~ubuntu20/Desktop/centraldb-portal/config (move key to your project)

14, Change permissions from root to user (Open new user terminal)
cd /Desktop/centraldb-portal/config (Go to your project config folder)
sudo chmod +r local.max.support.crt (Change permissions)
sudo chmod +r local.max.support.key (Change permissions)

15, run your HTTPS server
bin/dev -b "ssl://127.0.0.1:3000?cert=./config/local.max.support.crt&key=./config/local.max.support.key"(type cert password), (Dont forget to edit your .key, .crt files names)
