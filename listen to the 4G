Libpcap is a popular library for packet capture and network analysis on Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. It provides a programming interface for capturing network packets and analyzing their content. Here's a high-level overview of how to use libpcap:

Install libpcap:
Make sure you have libpcap installed on your system. You can install it using your distribution's package manager. For example, on Debian-based systems, you can use:

arduino
Copy code
sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev
Include the Necessary Header:
In your C or C++ program, include the libpcap header:

c
Copy code
#include <pcap.h>
Choose an Interface:
You need to select the network interface from which you want to capture packets. You can use the pcap_lookupdev function to get the default interface or specify one manually.

Open the Interface:
Use the pcap_open_live function to open the selected interface for packet capture:

c
Copy code
pcap_t *handle = pcap_open_live(interface, BUFSIZ, 1, 1000, errbuf);
if (handle == NULL) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Couldn't open device %s: %s\n", interface, errbuf);
    return 2;
}
Compile a Filter (Optional):
You can compile a packet filter using the pcap_compile function to capture specific types of packets based on filters. This step is optional but can be useful to narrow down captured packets.

Set the Filter (Optional):
Apply the compiled filter using the pcap_setfilter function:

c
Copy code
struct bpf_program fp;
if (pcap_compile(handle, &fp, filter_exp, 0, PCAP_NETMASK_UNKNOWN) == -1) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Couldn't parse filter %s: %s\n", filter_exp, pcap_geterr(handle));
    return 2;
}
if (pcap_setfilter(handle, &fp) == -1) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Couldn't install filter %s: %s\n", filter_exp, pcap_geterr(handle));
    return 2;
}
Capture Packets:
Use the pcap_loop function to capture packets in a loop:

c
Copy code
pcap_loop(handle, num_packets, packet_handler, NULL);
The packet_handler function is a callback that is called for each captured packet.

Close the Capture:
After you're done capturing packets, close the capture handle:

c
Copy code
pcap_close(handle);
Remember that using packet capture tools and libraries like libpcap should be done responsibly and ethically. Always ensure that you have the necessary permissions before capturing and analyzing network traffic.
